# Bulb-Control(Turn ON or OFF)-Using-Relay

This project focuses on controlling a standard AC bulb using a relay and microcontroller-based system.
The objective is to demonstrate how microcontrollers can interface with relays to switch high-voltage
appliances on or off safely.

## üìã Features

- **Serial Control:** Turn the bulb ON or OFF by sending commands ('1' for ON, '0' for OFF) through the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor.
- **Safe Isolation:** The relay provides electrical isolation, protecting the low-voltage Arduino from the high-voltage AC circuit.
- **Simple & Scalable:** The design is straightforward and can be easily expanded to control multiple appliances.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Required

* Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
* 5V Single Channel Relay Module
* AC Light Bulb with Holder
* Connecting Wires
